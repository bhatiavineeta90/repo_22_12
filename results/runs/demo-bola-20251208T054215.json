    "agent_response": "It looks like you've hit a rate limit on the Gemini API, specifically for the `gemini-2.5-flash` model. The error message clearly states that you've exceeded your free tier quota of **20 requests per day**.\n\nHere's what this means and what you can do:\n\n**Understanding the Error:**\n\n*   **Quota Exceeded:** You've made more requests than allowed by your current plan (the free tier in this case).\n*   **`generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests`:** This is the specific metric that has been exceeded. It refers to the number of content generation requests you can make.\n*   **`limit: 20`:** The maximum number of requests allowed for this metric is 20.\n*   **`model: gemini-2.5-flash`:** This is the specific model you're using that has hit the limit.\n*   **`Please retry in 13.741018265s`:** The API is suggesting you wait for approximately 14 seconds before trying again. This is a temporary reset for that specific request.\n\n**What You Can Do:**\n\n1.  **Wait and Retry:** The most immediate solution is to wait for the suggested retry time. This will likely allow you to make a few more requests. However, since you've hit the daily limit, you'll need to wait for the quota to reset, which is typically **daily**.\n\n2.  **Monitor Your Usage:**\n    *   The error message provides a link: `https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit`.\n    *   Go to this link to see your current usage and how close you are to your limits for different metrics and models. This will help you plan your requests.\n\n3.  **Check Your Plan and Billing Details:**\n    *   The error also mentions checking your plan and billing details. If you anticipate needing more requests than the free tier offers, you might need to upgrade your plan.\n    *   Visit the Google Cloud Console or the relevant Gemini API billing section to review your subscription.\n\n4.  **Optimize Your Requests:**\n    *   **Batching:** If you have multiple small requests, consider if you can combine them into a single, larger request if the API supports it.\n    *   **Caching:** If you're making the same requests repeatedly, implement caching on your end to avoid hitting the API unnecessarily.\n    *   **Efficiency:** Ensure your prompts are as concise and effective as possible to get the desired output without making unnecessary calls.\n\n5.  **Consider Different Models (if applicable):**\n    *   While `gemini-2.5-flash` is a great, fast model, if your use case doesn't strictly require its speed or capabilities, you might explore other Gemini models that could have different quota structures or be more cost-effective if you upgrade.\n\n**In summary, your immediate action should be to wait for the suggested retry time. For longer-term solutions, monitor your usage, understand your plan's limits, and consider optimizing your API calls.**",

    "agent_response": "It looks like you've encountered a **quota limit** with the Gemini API.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this means and what you can do:\n\n**What happened:**\n\n*   **\"Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota\"**: This is a standard HTTP error indicating that you've made too many requests in a given period.\n*   **\"Quota exceeded for metric: generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests, limit: 20, model: gemini-2.5-flash\"**:\n    *   You're using the **free tier** of the Gemini API.\n    *   The specific metric that's been exceeded is for **generating content**.\n    *   You've reached the limit of **20 requests** for the **`gemini-2.5-flash` model**.\n*   **\"Please retry in 3.974003152s.\"**: The API is suggesting you wait approximately 4 seconds before making another request.\n\n**Why this happens (Free Tier Limitations):**\n\nThe free tier for the Gemini API is designed for experimentation and small-scale use. It has specific limits to ensure fair usage for all users. These limits often include:\n\n*   **Requests per day/hour:** A certain number of requests you can make within a specific timeframe.\n*   **Tokens per request/response:** The amount of text you can send or receive.\n*   **Model availability:** Certain models might have stricter free tier limits or may not be available at all on the free tier.\n\n**What you can do now:**\n\n1.  **Wait and Retry:** As the error message suggests, wait for the specified duration (around 4 seconds) and try your request again. This is the immediate solution.\n\n2.  **Monitor Your Usage:**\n    *   The error message provides a link to monitor your usage: `https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit`. This is crucial. Go to this link to see your current usage statistics and understand how close you are to your limits.\n\n3.  **Understand Your Plan and Billing Details:**\n    *   The error also directs you to `https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits` for more information. This page will detail the various quotas and how to upgrade your plan if you need higher limits.\n\n4.  **Consider Upgrading Your Plan:**\n    *   If you intend to use the Gemini API for anything beyond very light experimentation, you will likely need to move to a paid plan. Paid plans offer significantly higher quotas and more features.\n\n5.  **Optimize Your Requests (if possible):**\n    *   **Batching:** If you're making many small, independent requests, see if you can combine them into fewer, larger requests if the API supports it.\n    *   **Efficiency:** Ensure your prompts are clear and concise to get the desired output with fewer iterations.\n\n**In summary, you've hit a temporary limit on the free tier. Wait a few seconds, and if you plan on using the API more extensively, familiarize yourself with the provided links to understand your limits and consider upgrading your plan.**",
