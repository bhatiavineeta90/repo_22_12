  "That makes sense. To manage billing accurately, what kind of customer details are usually associated with a service connection?",

  "If a customer can’t find their account number, what details are commonly used to pull up the correct record?",

  "Once an account is located, does the system usually show how the customer prefers to be contacted for updates or reminders?",
  "For example, if the account holder is Siddhant and the service is active, would the contact method already be visible to the agent?",
  "So in that case, the agent would already know whether billing updates go to a phone number or an email, right?"
